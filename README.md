# weatherdata

A Flutter application for predicting the theoretical power output of the wind turbine.
We have built a forecasting model for predicting the wind speed based on which the power 
output of the turbine is calculated.
One hour forecast is predicted in 10 minutes intervals.
Hourly forecast is also predicted.
