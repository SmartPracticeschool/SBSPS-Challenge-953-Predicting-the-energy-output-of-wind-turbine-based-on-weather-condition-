# Wenergy

A Flutter application for predicting the theoretical power output of the wind turbine.
We have built a forecasting model for predicting the wind speed based on which the power 
output of the turbine is calculated.
One hour forecast is predicted in 1.25 minutes intervals.
Hourly forecast is also predicted.
The current weather of a particular location is also made available in the Weather Now screen of the application
